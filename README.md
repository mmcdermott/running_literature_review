# Running Literature Review

Here I'll maintain a running record of literature I've read, topics I've learned about, etc., to help cement my own learnings and allow others to benefit from it (eventually--this is a stretch goal not yet realized). The list below is not remotely up to date in terms of papers I have read or want to read. As of now, this github is strictly for my own benefit, and all opinions are (obviously) my own and are recorded for solely my own posterity -- they aren't commentary on the works in any real sense, as that would require both (1) likely more thought, and (2) more careful communication to ensure my message is accurately conveyed. That all said, please feel free to leave any comments, suggestions, or thoughts via github issues.

#### TODOs: 
  1. Add papers currently notated to list below.
  2. Finish structuring list below.
  3. Evaluate format

## Paper/Topic Queue
Maintenance is at a best effort level. Until decided otherwise, this won't be sorted by topic, the relevant sub-works will be nested.
