  * **Summary**:
    - _Single Big Problem/Question_ Medical ontologies are useful in many contexts, but require embeddings to use effectively, and current models to produce such embeddings can be improved.
    - _Solution Proposed_ This model leverages a hierarchical attention model to leverage the hierarchical structure of medical ontologies to learn embeddings for nodes that are not only dependent on their immediate node identity but also on the full hierarchy of ancestor nodes.
    - _Why hasn't this been done before?_ Prior work has explored attention over ancestors (in particular, GRAM does this), but these model have used ancestors as an _unordered set_ of ancestors, rather than a hierarchical ontology of ancestors  descendents (which GRAM ignores) in its own right, which this paper explores. In addition, graph neural networks and attention architectures are relatively new and still under active development.
    - _Experiments used to justify?_
      1) 2 sequential procedure/diagnosis prediction tasks (over the ACTFAST and MIMIC-III datasets as sequences of codes)
    - _Secret Terrible Thing(s)_
      1) Comparisons are a not on GRAM's home turf, and they need to greatly restrict the number of layers of the hierarchy they use to acheive great results. Restricting the # of ontological layers _should_ cut the benefits of their approach, as the ontological complexity of the ancestor/descendent ontology is much reduced. But, this also points to key con #3 -- their model can't actually effectively leverage that information, I expect.

  * **Detailed Methodology**:
    HAP breaks down attention propagation into two message-passing phases:
      1) Bottom-up propagation: the embedding for node i is updated via attention computation over its immediate _ancestors_ (& itself).
      2) Top-down propagation:  the embedding for node i is updated via attention computation over its immediate _descendents_ (& itself).
    They do this in sequence, not in parallel -- e.g., for round one of propagation, they update the graph downwards, using the updated node values for each subsequent layer--in particular, the random initialization embeddings are used as the raw ancestor inputs only for the lowest layer, and subsequent layers up towards the root (top) node use the embeddings computed over the attention over those nodes' ancestors).
    
    Final modelling is done via an RNN over sequences of medical codes, with each timepoint represented as a nonlinear transform of the sum of the embeddings at a particular visit.
  * **Pros**:
    - They prove that HAP is strictly more expressive than GRAM.
    - They compare across two datasets, and compare to GRAM, a relevant baseline, plus some others.
  * **Cons**:
    - Utility of HAP is strictly tied to utility of GRAM -- HAP is exclusively an improvement to GRAM.
    - Each propagation (down and up) needs to process over the entire graph sequentially. This has a high time complexity. They claim GRAM can have a higher time complexity, but I'm not sure if this is true without reading GRAM -- my instinct is that it is not.
    - Information from lower layers in the hierarchy will decay over multiple attention computations prior to reaching the top of the graph.
    - They don't directly compare to GRAM on GRAM's published tasks -- GRAM reduces comparison space to CCS concepts -- they use full ICD codes. This may bias comparison.
    - Results aren't super compelling.
  * **Open Questions**:
    - Are there really no interleaving other improvements to GRAM? GRAM came out in 2017.
    - What ontology do they use?
  * **Extensions**:
    - Solve con 3: decay of information across layer.
  * **How to learn more**: N/A
